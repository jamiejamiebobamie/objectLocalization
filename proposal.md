**Project Name:**
Object Localization


**Is your project New or Old?**
New


**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Solo


## Description

I hope to write code using Python/Keras/Deep-Learning to implemenet Object Localization.

Among other resources, I will be reviewing [this repo](https://github.com/lars76/object-localization) in order to tackle this topic.

I hope to gain a stronger grasp of common deep learning libraries and frameworks such as Keras and SciKitLearn and to strengthen my Data Science portfolio.

## Objective 1:

Implement code that takes in an image and extracts the features from the pixel data.

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?**

I want to do this, because it is a necessary step of CNNs and object detection.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?**

The code will reflect this step / ability.

## Objective 2:

Implement code that draws a bounding box around the image, localizing it within the image.

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?**

This is sort of the primary goal for the project.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?**

Users who fork my repo will be able to input an image and get a prediction as to where a particular class of object is likely to be.

## Objective 3:

Launch a basic site on AWS Beanstalk that allows users to upload images from their computer and recieve a prediction.

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?**

A more user-friendly interface would allow non-tech people to interact with what I've built.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?**

The site will be live.

## Stretch goals (optional):

**What stretch goals do you have for your project?**

None
