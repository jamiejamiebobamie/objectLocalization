**Project Name:** 
Object Localization


**Is your project New or Old?**
New


**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Solo


## Description

I hope to write code using Python/Keras/Deep-Learning to implemenet Object Localization.

Among other resources, I will be reviewing [this repo](https://github.com/lars76/object-localization) in order to tackle this topic.

I hope to gain a stronger grasp of common deep learning libraries and frameworks such as Keras and SciKitLearn and to strengthen my Data Science portfolio.

## Objective 1: say your objective here, you must have at least three objectives to get credit for the intensive… accomplishing objective should be done by soley you

Implement code that takes in an image and extracts the features from the pixel data.

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 

I want to do this, because it is a necessary step of CNNs and object detection.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 

The code will reflect this step / ability.

## Objective 2: ... say your objective to accomplish here …
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 

Implement code that draws a bounding box around the image, localizing it within the image.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 

Users who fork my repo will be able to input an image and get a prediction as to where a particular class of object is likely to be.

## Stretch goals (optional):

**What stretch goals do you have for your project?**

None
